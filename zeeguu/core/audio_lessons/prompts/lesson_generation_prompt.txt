Create a language learning audio script for the {target_language} word "{origin_word}" meaning "{translation_word}".
Note that the lesson is for somebody who is CEFT level {cefr_level} so ensure that sentences are of the appropriate difficulty.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the script lines below. Do not include any explanations, preambles, or additional text.

Use this exact format:

Teacher: You will be practicing the word [0.5 seconds]
Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: which means {translation_word}.
Teacher: In this dialogue you will hear a man and woman discussing [brief scenario]

[Create 4-6 dialogue lines between Man and Woman using the target word naturally]

Teacher: Let's practice some key phrases [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: Could you say [simple phrase with target word]? [5 seconds]
Man: [target language phrase] [3 seconds]
Man: [repeat same phrase] [3 seconds]

Teacher: Now try to say [another simple phrase]? [5 seconds]
Woman: [target language phrase] [3 seconds]
Woman: [repeat same phrase] [3 seconds]

RULES:
- Use only "Teacher:", "Man:", "Woman:" labels
- Include [X seconds] timing for pauses
- Teacher speaks English, Man/Woman speak {target_language}
- For situations where a {target_language} word is inserted in the teacher text,
the dialogue should be changed to the native voice with 0.5 seconds break like below:

Teacher: You will be practicing the word [0.5 seconds]
Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: which means {translation_word}.

- Keep vocabulary simple (A1-A2 level)
- For student response pauses, use [5 seconds] after teacher questions
- For repetitions, use [3 seconds] between repeats
- No explanatory text or translations in the script
