Create a language learning audio script for the {target_language} word "{origin_word}" meaning "{translation_word}".
Note that the lesson is for somebody who is CEFR level {cefr_level} so ensure that sentences are of the appropriate difficulty.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the script lines below. Do not include any explanations, preambles, or additional text.

Use this exact format:

Teacher: You will be practicing the word [0.5 seconds]
Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: which means {translation_word}.
Teacher: In this dialogue you will hear a man and woman discussing <brief scenario, also describe the relation between the man and woman>

Create a dialogue of at least 8 lines between Man and Woman using the target word naturally.
In between lines add one second break annotations with: [1 seconds]

Next, add the teacher's voice that says something similar to:
"Let's now engage you and test your ability to converse in Spanish."

Take each line of the dialogue again and after each line of dialogue make the teacher add
a challenge for the listener. In this challenge, the teacher will say something similar to 
the following example (diversify the way the teacher formulates the challenge):

Teacher: Let's practice some key phrases [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: Could you say [simple phrase with target word]? [5 seconds]
Man: <target language phrase> [3 seconds]
Man: <repeat same phrase> [3 seconds]

Use as many challenges as possible from the dialogue.

Add 4 more similar challenges from the teacher, but this time with examples out of the dialogue,
with commonly used contexts for the word.

In these challenges or any instruction from the teacher, make sure if the target word aka {origin_word} in the
target language aka {target_language} is used, then you will use the format where the Man's voice 
jumps in and reads the target word, not the teacher. Example:

Teacher: [whatever instruction from the teacher, similar to this, eg:] "Another context where the" [0.5 seconds]
Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: "is used is ..."


RULES:
- Use only "Teacher:", "Man:", "Woman:" labels
- Include [X seconds] timing for pauses
- Teacher always and only speaks English, Man/Woman speak {target_language}
- For situations where a {target_language} word is inserted in the teacher text,
the dialogue should be changed to the native voice with 0.5 seconds break like below:

Teacher: You will be practicing the word [0.5 seconds]
Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
Teacher: which means {translation_word}.

- Keep vocabulary simple (A1-A2 level)
- For student response pauses, use [5 seconds] after teacher questions
- For repetitions, use [3 seconds] between repeats
- No explanatory text or translations in the script
