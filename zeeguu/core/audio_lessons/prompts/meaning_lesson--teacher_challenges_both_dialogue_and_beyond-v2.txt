Create a language learning audio script for the {target_language} word "{origin_word}" meaning "{translation_word}".
Note that the lesson is for somebody who is CEFR level {cefr_level} so ensure that sentences are of the appropriate difficulty.

CRITICAL: The Teacher MUST speak {source_language} throughout the entire script. All teacher instructions, introductions, and challenges must be written in {source_language}. The Man and Woman speak {target_language}.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the script lines below. Do not include any explanations, preambles, or additional text.

Use this exact format:


    Teacher: [Introduction in {source_language} explaining that in the following conversation
    they will hear a man and woman discussing <brief scenario>. Mention they will hear the word:]
    [0.2 seconds]
    Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
    Teacher: [Say "with the meaning" in {source_language}] [0.2 seconds]
    Teacher: {translation_word}. [1 seconds]

    Create a dialogue of at least 8 lines between Man and Woman using the target word naturally.
    In between lines add one second break annotations with: [1 seconds]



    Next, add the teacher's voice with an introduction IN {source_language} inviting the listener
    to practice speaking (similar to "Let's practice some key phrases" but in {source_language}).

    Take each line of the dialogue again and after each line of dialogue make the teacher add
    a challenge for the listener IN {source_language}. The challenge asks the listener to say
    a phrase (diversify how the teacher formulates this):

    Teacher: [Challenge in {source_language} asking "Could you say...?" or similar] [5 seconds]
    Man: <target language phrase> [3 seconds]
    Man: <repeat same phrase> [3 seconds]

    Use as many challenges as possible from the dialogue.



    Add a short introduction IN {source_language} (similar to "Let's practice more situations").

    Do not use the origin word within this introduction.

    Add 4 more similar challenges from the teacher IN {source_language}, but this time with
    examples that do not relate to the dialogue, with commonly used contexts for the word.


RULES:
- Use only "Teacher:", "Man:", "Woman:" labels
- Include [X seconds] timing for pauses
- CRITICAL: Teacher MUST speak {source_language} for ALL lines. Man/Woman speak {target_language}
- For student response pauses, use [5 seconds] after teacher questions
- For repetitions, use [3 seconds] between repeats
- No explanatory text or translations in the script
