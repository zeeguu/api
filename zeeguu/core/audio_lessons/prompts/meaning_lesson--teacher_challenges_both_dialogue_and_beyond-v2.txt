Create a language learning audio script for the {target_language} word "{origin_word}" meaning "{translation_word}".
Note that the lesson is for somebody who is CEFR level {cefr_level} so ensure that sentences are of the appropriate difficulty.

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the script lines below. Do not include any explanations, preambles, or additional text.

Use this exact format:


    Teacher: In the following conversation you will hear a man and woman discussing 
    <brief scenario, also describe the relation between the man and woman>.
    Throughout the dialogue, you will hear the word [0.2 seconds]
    Man: {origin_word} [0.5 seconds]
    Teacher: with the meaning [0.2 seconds] 
    Teacher: {translation_word}.

    Create a dialogue of at least 8 lines between Man and Woman using the target word naturally.
    In between lines add one second break annotations with: [1 seconds]



    Next, add the teacher's voice that says something similar to (but diversify):
    "Let's now engage you and test your ability to converse in Spanish" or "Let's practice some key phrases"

    Take each line of the dialogue again and after each line of dialogue make the teacher add
    a challenge for the listener. In this challenge, the teacher will say something similar to 
    the following example (diversify the way the teacher formulates the challenge):

    Teacher: Could you say [simple phrase with target word]? [5 seconds]
    Man: <target language phrase> [3 seconds]
    Man: <repeat same phrase> [3 seconds]

    Use as many challenges as possible from the dialogue.



    Use a short introduction to this part that has a similar form with:

    Teacher: "Let's us practise some more situations where the word is used". 

    Do not use the origin word within this introduction. 

    Add 4 more similar challenges from the teacher, but this time with examples that do not relate to the dialogue,
    with commonly used contexts for the word.



    At the end, use the teacher to voice an ending sentence for the lesson with the following script:
    Teacher: "This is the end of today's audio lesson with Zeeguu. Hope you enjoyed learning new words with us. See you on tomorrow's new lesson!"


RULES:
- Use only "Teacher:", "Man:", "Woman:" labels
- Include [X seconds] timing for pauses
- Teacher always and only speaks English, Man/Woman speak {target_language}
- For student response pauses, use [5 seconds] after teacher questions
- For repetitions, use [3 seconds] between repeats
- No explanatory text or translations in the script
