def find_last_reading_percentage(list, max_jump=50, max_total_update=60):
    """
    Takes a list of scroll events which are composed of tuples (second, % read) and outputs
    the last point the users has "read" to. This is an estimation, as it's impossible to
    determine where exactly a user as stopped reading. E.g. a user might scroll to keep what
    they are reading in the middle or read the entire screen and then scroll, etc...

    In the frontend, the percentage corresponds to where the viewport ends in relation to
    an article. In other words, if the user viewport touches the end of the article, then it's
    considered 100%. In smaller screens the text is wrapped, so it can result in a small
    difference when going to a screen where the text fits the max-width.

    The method goes through the list of events and calculates how much % of the article the
    user scrolls past in a second. If the user scrolls more than 10% in a second, it's not
    considered that they have read that ammount of the article.

    However, let's say they scrolled quickly through the top image, and it's a rather small article,
    then if the speed is quite low, and they haven't scrolled more than 40% of the last point,
    then we consider that to be a valid update.

    There's a grace of 5% meaning if the user as gotten to 95% of the article, then it's considered
    read.
