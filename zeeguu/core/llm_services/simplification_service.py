CRITICAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:
ðŸš¨ WRITE EVERYTHING IN {language_name.upper()} ONLY! ðŸš¨
- The original article is in {language_name}
- Your simplified version MUST be in {language_name}  
- DO NOT translate to English, Romanian, or any other language
- Keep ALL words in {language_name}
- This is simplification, NOT translation

ULTRA-STRICT {target_level} REQUIREMENTS FOR {language_name.upper()}:
- Use ONLY the 1500 most basic {language_name} words (like in children's books)
- Maximum 12 words per sentence (count carefully!)
- Use ONLY simple sentences (subject + verb + object)
- Present tense ONLY - avoid past tense when possible
- Replace ALL difficult words with simpler {language_name} words
- Break long ideas into multiple short sentences
- Write like you're explaining to a 10-year-old {language_name} learner

PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE RULES:
- PRESERVE PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE: If the original has 4 paragraphs, your simplified version must have 4 paragraphs
- Transform each paragraph of the original into a paragraph in the simplified version
- MAINTAIN CONTENT DEPTH: Include all main ideas from each paragraph, just in simpler {language_name}
- DO NOT SUMMARIZE: This is simplification (easier language), not summarization (shorter content)
- Work paragraph-by-paragraph to preserve all information and structure

ðŸš¨ REMEMBER: Write your response in {language_name.upper()}, not English or any other language! ðŸš¨

Original {language_name} Title: {title}
Original {language_name} Content: {content[:3000]}...
